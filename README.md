# MMPG-Test

################################# Goal #################################

The client would like to create a Web-App written in PHP with a database in mySQL that displays different information based on the user’s geolocation. It should be deployed in a Google Cloud environment.

################################# My tasks #################################

Create a website from scratch (without using a framework) that has the following features and characteristics:
  1. Have a top navigation bar with the following options:
  
      a. Casablanca
      b. Fès
      c. Rabat
      
  2. Have information about the city chosen by the user appearing on screen (only one sentence is required, more is appreciated). A city is chosen when the user picks it on the navigation bar or when its location matches the specific city.
  
  3. Have the browser use the user’s geolocation and check if it is in one of the three cities, if yes, redirect the user to the specified page.
  
  4. Animate all style changes in Javascript (no use of CSS “transition” to perform animations).
  
  5. Write in a mySQL database the number of visits for each page. Display the result on the specific page (be original with the display, you are 100% free).
  
  6. Deploy the solution (app and database) in google cloud using App Engine and SQL Cloud.
  
  7. Loading times should be animated.
